Description: Our app is meant for explorers who want to keep track of the nature they see. It uses AI to identify various species of plants and animals and then allows the user to add them to their collection. The user can then view their collection and see the different species they have seen.

## Inspiration

We were inspired by the fact that many people are interested in nature but don't know what they are looking at. We wanted to create an app that would allow people to explore and learn about the nature around them. It would also act as a reward system for people who are interested in nature.
